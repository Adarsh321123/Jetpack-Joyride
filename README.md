# Game Design Document

## Section 0: Summary
This section should tell the reader what to expect in the future sections.  In particular, it should contain at least:
- a working title for your game
- a list of your team members (and their roles if decided)
- a "concept statement" of your game ("your game in a tweet")

## Section 1: Gameplay
This section should address simple questions about how your game works:
- How does your game progress?
- What are the win and loss conditions?
- Are there levels?
- Are there points?

This section should also address:
- **controls** (keyboard? mouse? tongue?)
- **physics** (how does your game incorporate the physics engine?)
- **game flow** (what does the game look like from start to end for the player?)
- **graphics** (will you draw polygons? use sprites? make your own vector graphics?)

## Section 2: Feature Set
This section should reduce your game to a set of individual features (remember iterative development?).  Your team should
assign these features to individual group members and assign each one a priority from one to four (1 = game cannot work without this, 4 = cool but not necessary).

We have gathered together the following list of some example features you might choose to implement:
- make your own graphics or sprites
- add sound effects
- implement a scrolling environment
- implement a networked/multiplayer game
- implement 2D parallax (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax)
- implement rendering of text
- implement a mouse handler
- implement an AI for an enemy
- implement speed-independent friction
- implement more accurate integration (current implementation uses a trapezoid sum)
- implement music

## Section 3: Timeline
This section should assign every feature in the previous section to a particular group member and a particular week they will implement it.

## Section 4: Disaster Recovery
This section should describe how each member plans to get back on track if they fall behind.  Please take this section seriously.
