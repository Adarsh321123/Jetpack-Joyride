# Game Design Document

## Section 0: Summary
This section should tell the reader what to expect in the future sections.  In particular, it should contain at least:
- a working title for your game
- a list of your team members (and their roles if decided)
- a "concept statement" of your game ("your game in a tweet")

## Section 1: Gameplay
This section should address simple questions about how your game works:
- How does your game progress?
- What are the win and loss conditions?
- Are there levels?
- Are there points?

This section should also address:
- **controls** (keyboard? mouse? tongue?)
- **physics** (how does your game incorporate the physics engine?)
- **game flow** (what does the game look like from start to end for the player?)
- **graphics** (will you draw polygons? use sprites? make your own vector graphics?)

## Section 2: Feature Set
This section should reduce your game to a set of individual features (remember iterative development?).  Your team should
assign these features to individual group members and assign each one a priority from one to four (1 = game cannot work without this, 4 = cool but not necessary).

To turn priorities into a grade at the end of the term, we will apply the following rules:
- If all priority 1 features are implemented, we guarantee a minimum grade of D on the team portion of the game.
- If all priority 2 features are implemented, we guarantee a minimum grade of C on the team portion of the game.
- If all priority 3 features are implemented, we guarantee a minimum grade of B on the team portion of the game.
- If all priority 4 features are implemented, we guarantee a minimum grade of A- on the team portion of the game.

If your group does not distribute work evenly, we recind all promises made above.

You *must* have a minimum of **four** features (one of each priority) per group member.  Features will vary in difficulty, and we understand that, but nonetheless, we're expecting at least that many total.

We have gathered together the following list of some example features you might choose to implement:
- make your own graphics or sprites
- add sound effects
- implement a scrolling environment
- implement a networked/multiplayer game
- implement 2D parallax (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax)
- implement rendering of text
- implement a mouse handler
- implement an AI for an enemy
- implement speed-independent friction
- implement more accurate integration (current implementation uses a trapezoid sum)
- implement music

## Section 3: Timeline
This section should assign every feature in the previous section to a particular group member and a particular week they will implement it.

## Section 4: Disaster Recovery
This section should describe how each member plans to get back on track if they fall behind.  Please take this section seriously.
